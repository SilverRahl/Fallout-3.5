    "instructions": "**Fallout 3.5**\rWhole Sheet: I changed skills like repair, science, outdoorsman and speech. Then created many skills for them. I did that because skills like science can be very tricky. Hacking was under it, craftings were under it. So now they have own skills. Animalism for animal handle, tame and helps you with skining. Armorsmith for both armor crafting and making some outfit. And so on. \rPrime Tab: Included height value for character and changed sp per level value for purpose of support increased amount of skills. \rSkill tab: Fixed some bugs for earlier 3.0 sheet and added 11 new skills along with tag skill. So tagging skill will increase that skill for 20 points. \rTrait tab: Changed the name of this tab as perks. \rInventoryTab: Location name has changed with amount."
